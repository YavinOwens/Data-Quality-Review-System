## Analytical Engineering

### 1. Data Quality Metrics Framework

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Data Completeness Score**
  ```sql
  -- Calculate data completeness
  SELECT 
      ROUND(
          (COUNT(*) - SUM(CASE 
              WHEN first_name IS NULL OR last_name IS NULL 
              OR email IS NULL OR date_of_birth IS NULL 
              OR national_insurance_number IS NULL 
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
          )) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
      ) as completeness_score
  FROM dq_review;
  ```
  - Measures percentage of complete records
  - Weighted scoring for critical fields
  - Trend analysis over time

- **Data Accuracy Score**
  ```sql
  -- Calculate data accuracy
  SELECT 
      ROUND(
          (COUNT(*) - SUM(CASE 
              WHEN has_name_issues = 'Y' 
              OR has_email_issues = 'Y'
              OR has_dob_issues = 'Y'
              OR has_nino_issues = 'Y'
              OR has_address_issues = 'Y'
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
          )) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
      ) as accuracy_score
  FROM dq_review;
  ```
  - Measures percentage of accurate records
  - Validates against business rules
  - Historical accuracy tracking

- **Data Consistency Score**
  ```sql
  -- Calculate data consistency
  SELECT 
      ROUND(
          (COUNT(*) - SUM(CASE 
              WHEN validation_comments LIKE '%inconsistent%'
              OR validation_comments LIKE '%mismatch%'
              OR validation_comments LIKE '%conflict%'
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
          )) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
      ) as consistency_score
  FROM dq_review;
  ```
  - Measures internal data consistency
  - Cross-field validation
  - Relationship validation

### 2. Advanced Analytics

#### Predictive Analytics
- **Issue Prediction Model**
  ```sql
  -- Identify patterns leading to data quality issues
  SELECT 
      person_types,
      COUNT(*) as total_records,
      SUM(CASE WHEN has_name_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as name_issues,
      SUM(CASE WHEN has_email_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as email_issues,
      ROUND(
          SUM(CASE WHEN has_name_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
      ) as name_issue_rate,
      ROUND(
          SUM(CASE WHEN has_email_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
      ) as email_issue_rate
  FROM dq_review
  GROUP BY person_types
  ORDER BY total_records DESC;
  ```
  - Identifies high-risk record types
  - Predicts potential issues
  - Risk scoring

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue Correlation Matrix**
  ```sql
  -- Analyze correlations between different types of issues
  SELECT 
      CASE WHEN has_name_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as name_issue,
      CASE WHEN has_email_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as email_issue,
      CASE WHEN has_dob_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as dob_issue,
      CASE WHEN has_nino_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as nino_issue,
      COUNT(*) as record_count
  FROM dq_review
  GROUP BY 
      CASE WHEN has_name_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
      CASE WHEN has_email_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
      CASE WHEN has_dob_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
      CASE WHEN has_nino_issues = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END;
  ```
  - Identifies issue patterns
  - Determines common combinations
  - Suggests root causes
