## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings from the address validation exercise conducted using the extract_address_components.sql and create_transformation_log.sql procedures. The analysis focuses on two key aspects:
1. House number extraction and validation
2. Postcode format validation and standardization

## Minimum Components for Data Matching
The following components are required for successful address matching:
1. House Number
   - Must be present at the start of the address
   - Can include letters (e.g., "123A")
   - Must be followed by a space

2. Postcode
   - Must follow UK postcode format
   - Must be present in the address
   - Must be in the correct position (usually at the end)

## Findings

### 1. House Number Analysis
#### Overview
- Total addresses processed: [Number]
- Addresses with valid house numbers: [Number]
- Success rate: [Percentage]%

#### Details
- Pattern used: `^[0-9]+[A-Za-z]*`
- Valid formats:
  - Simple numbers (e.g., "123")
  - Numbers with letters (e.g., "123A")
  - Numbers with multiple letters (e.g., "123AB")

#### Issues Identified
1. Missing house numbers
2. House numbers in incorrect position
3. Non-standard formats

### 2. Postcode Analysis
#### Overview
- Total addresses processed: [Number]
- Addresses with valid postcodes: [Number]
- Success rate: [Percentage]%

#### Standard Format Validation
- Pattern used: [Postcode validation pattern]
- Valid formats:
  - Standard UK format (e.g., "SW1A 1AA")
  - Special cases (e.g., "BF1 1AA" for British Forces)

#### Issues Identified
1. Non-standard formats
2. Missing postcodes
3. Incorrect positioning

### 3. Combined Validation Results
#### Overall Success Rate
- Total addresses: [Number]
- Fully valid addresses: [Number]
- Success rate: [Percentage]%

#### Common Issues
1. Missing components
2. Format violations
3. Position errors

## Recommendations

### 1. Data Quality Improvements
- Implement automated validation for new addresses
- Add data quality checks during address entry
- Regular validation of existing addresses

### 2. Process Improvements
- Standardize address entry format
- Implement validation at point of entry
- Regular review of validation rules

### 3. Manual Review Requirements
- Review addresses with special postcodes
- Verify addresses with non-standard house numbers
- Check addresses with missing components

## Appendix

   - Must be at start of address

2. Postcode Rules
   - Must follow UK format
   - Must be present
   - Must be in correct position

### B. Transformation Log Details

- Examples of invalid addresses
- Common error patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review findings with stakeholders
2. Implement recommended improvements
3. Schedule follow-up validation
4. Update documentation as needed
