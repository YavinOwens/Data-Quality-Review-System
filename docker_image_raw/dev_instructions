Docker enables the development of solutions on various databases.

This example uses Oracle 19c. This repository also contains instructions for Oracle versions 11, 12, 13, 19, and 23-e.

Requirements:
1. Docker installation is required (see README.md for more details)
2. Download the Oracle Database 19c (19.1.0.0.0) for Linux ARM64 from the official Oracle website:
   - Visit: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle19c-linux-arm64-downloads.html
   - Download: LINUX.ARM64_1919000_db_home.zip (approximately 2GB)
   - Place the downloaded ZIP file in the docker_image_raw directory

For troubleshooting, please refer to the Docker Cheat Sheet for the setup of Oracle docker images.

Note: The LINUX.ARM64_1919000_db_home.zip file is not included in this repository due to its large size (2GB).
You must download it separately from the Oracle website.
